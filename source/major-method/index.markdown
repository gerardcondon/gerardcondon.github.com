This page describes the [Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system) for remembering numbers and gives lists of sample words for each number from 0 - 99.
I've mostly used the words from [Timothy Kenny's page](http://timothykenny.com/accelerated-learning/major-system-cheat-sheet-for-1-100). I've change a few to try to keep the same first letter for each group of ten (or at most two first letters). 
I've formatted them and presented them here so that I would always have a copy.
If these words don't work for you then there is a word generator [here](http://major-system.info/en).

The idea is to convert the number to consonants and then add vowels until you have a word. To get the number back you simply drop the vowels and then convert the remaining consonants back to the digit they represent.
 
number	| phonetic          	| Word	    | reminder	    |
------- | --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
0	    | s, z, or soft c	    | Saw	    |	‘z’ is the start of zero
1	    |	d, t, th	        |	Tie	    |	‘t’ and ‘d’ have 1 downstroke
2	    |	n	                |	Hen	        |	‘n’ has 2 downstrokes	    
3	    |	m	                |	Ham	    |	‘m’ has 3 downstrokes	    
4	    |	r	                |	Oar	    |	4 ends in “r”   
5	    |	l	                |	Whale	    |	5 fingers, with thumb held out, makes an L shape; L is roman numeral for 50;
6	    |	j, sh, soft ch, dg, soft g	            |	Shoe |	6 is like a golf club, which makes a ‘ch’ sound in the grass	    
7	    |	k, hard ch, hard c, hard g, ng, qu	    |	Cow |	K is like two 7s rotated and combined	    
8	    |	f, v	            |	UFO	    |	8 looks like a small cursive f	    
9	    |	b, p	            |	Bee	    |	9 is a rotated b and a flipped p
