One issue I had with my Linx 7 was that the battery was draining really quickly in standby mode. I was having to shut down the tablet completely between uses. I found [this](http://www.linxtablet.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=214#p1139) page on a Linx forum site which recommended upgrading the wifi driver. I installed the driver and now the standby battery life is excellent.
