Here's my initial blog post. I'm creating this blog as I've decided to create iOS apps in my spare time. Up to now I've been working as a programmer for eight years in Java, C++ and C. I've never written an Objective C application before nor programmed on the Mac. Also I've never blogged before so this is a totally new experience for me.

Given the time of year, there is a lot of advice regarding New Year Resolutions and how to stick with them. One of the ideas is that by telling your resolution to other people, this acts as positive reinforcement to actually carry it out. My version of that is this blog. I am making a commitment to create and publish an app to the app store. After that, we'll see.

I want to use this blog to document my journey to learn not only the technical aspects e.g. learning Objective C and Xcode, but also the other non software activities that come with creating and publishing software. This will no doubt change with time as (hopefully) I start to release apps but will do for a starting point.
