Google and Samsung announced some new [Chromebooks](http://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/xe513c24-k01us-xe513c24-k01us/) which will be able to [run Android apps](https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/new-generation-chromebooks-designed-work-millions-apps/).
These look fantastic, especially for the price.
On my current Macbook Air, I basically spend the majority of my time in the browser anyway so moving to a Chromebook wouldn't be that much of a big deal.
