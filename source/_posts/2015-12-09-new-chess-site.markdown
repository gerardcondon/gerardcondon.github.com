I wanted to learn how to create websites using [Bootstrap][] so I've created a chess site at [www.gerardcondon.com/chess](http://www.gerardcondon.com/chess).
This is a static site developed using [Middleman][]. It uses Bootstrap and [pgn4web][] to display chess games and allow the viewer to play through them.

[Bootstrap]: http://www.getbootstrap.com
[Middleman]: http://www.middlemanapp.com
[pgn4web]: http://pgn4web.casaschi.net/home.html
