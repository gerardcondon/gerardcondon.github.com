Got hooked on this Final Fantasy 7 [speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWgb-Jrk5tQ). The strats are incredible. How they manage the step count is beyond me.

And here's a [run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjKKvWvPups) for FF8 which looks good. Again this step counter stuff takes incredible skill.

Loved those two Final Fantasy games in particular. Series high point for me - apart from 12 they never hit those heights again.
