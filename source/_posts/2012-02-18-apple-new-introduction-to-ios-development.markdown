Apple has posted a [new guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/Introduction/Introduction.html) to iOS development which ties together all the various strands of creating an app. (via [Loop Insight](http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/02/17/apple-posts-guide-to-start-developing-ios-apps/)). Looks really nice.
