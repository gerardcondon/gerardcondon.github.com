One thing about Objective C that struck me is the amount of boiler plate code that needs to be written for variables and methods. Ideally Xcode would handle all this but unfortunately it doesn't.

An app I found to solve this problem is [Accessorizer](http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html). It can generate interface and implementation for properties plus a whole range of other code (all that KVO and coding stuff that I haven't looked into yet). It's only 4 euro on the Mac App Store and it's well worth it. There are some videos tutorials on the site which show you how much can be done with the program.
