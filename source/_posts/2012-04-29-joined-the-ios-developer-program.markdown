I've been fairly busy with the Start Your Own Business course so I haven't had much time to do iOS programming. It's time to get back into it now though, and so I've just paid my subscription to the iOS developer program. I'm looking forward to being able to run code on an actual device. It's been a bit limiting working on just the simulator and there's nothing like seeing your code running on the final hardware.
