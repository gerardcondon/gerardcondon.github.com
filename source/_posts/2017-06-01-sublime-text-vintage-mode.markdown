I started learning Vim recently and it works fantastically well on Linux. 
Windows is a bit of a mess though and I'm not confident of getting plugins working correctly. 
Maybe the new Linux subsystem for Windows will help this. 

In the meantime I've enabled vintage mode on Sublime Text and it seems to be working well. 
The main thing it gives me is the keyboard navigation keys. 
Not having to use the mouse or arrow keys is a big win. 
I never realised how good it would be until I tried it.
