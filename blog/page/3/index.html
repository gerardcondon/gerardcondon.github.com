  <div class="entry-content"><p>I had a draft post pre-written earlier this year lamenting the decline of the SRPG game genre. In brief, I used to import these types of games all the time from America for my PS2. I assumed that this would continue for the PS3 and really enjoyed <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/games/valkyria-chronicles-ps3">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, but after that the genre has pretty much disappeared for the mainstream consoles. Even on PSN and Xbox live, there has been very little released (<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/vandal-hearts-flames-of-judgment-review">Vandal Hearts</a> excepted). Modern games seemed to be limited more and more to mass market genres such as the 3D first person shooter.</p>

<p>However in the past month a surprising new development in game development has kind of invalidated my draft post. Veteran game designers have started to use Kickstarter to seek funding for niche game genres with some amazing results. The first big <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure">success</a> on Kickstarter was Tim Schafer, Ron Gilbert and Double Fine raising over three million to make a new adventure game. I love the Monkey Island games so I backed this - it was actually the first thing I&#8217;d ever supported on Kickstarter. I have no idea if the game will be any good but given the caliber of the people involved, I think it&#8217;s in safe hands. To be honest, the videos they&#8217;ve made for the project have been worth the cash already.</p>

<p>Following on from that Brian Fargo launched a <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2">Wasteland 2</a> project. This is an attempt to revive the party based CRPGs. This was another genre that I really enjoyed and which stagnated recently. Today&#8217;s publishers aren&#8217;t willing to put up the cash for these games. I&#8217;ve started to contribute to more of these gaming projects on Kickstarter (including a space based game - <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/64409699/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a> and a Norse SRPG - <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stoic/the-banner-saga">The Banner Saga</a>). Hopefully this will show that there is a sizable market for these games and they will be more likely to be funded in future. It&#8217;s really interesting how much more invested in the games you feel once you back them on Kickstarter. For example, I&#8217;m really enjoying reading the updates from the game developers. If I was an indie developer I would definitely go down this route. The community that the Kickstarter project creates for your game might be as important as the funding itself.</p>

<p>Another other thing this has made me realize is how much reputation and track record matters. I had never heard of Wasteland 2 before backing it. However once Brian Fargo reeled off the list of games that he&#8217;d worked on, i.e. Fallout, Baldur&#8217;s Gate and Icewind Dale (all of which still sit proudly on my shelf), I had no hesitation in subscribing. I would much rather see people like him develop games instead of leaving it in the hands of companies like Zynga. Trying to learn from this, I think that having a portfolio would be really valuable for a software engineer. Imagine the kind of CV/resume you&#8217;d have if you developed one app, website or side project per year and hosted these online. Given the frameworks and services that are out there e.g. <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>, <a href="http://www.parse.com">Parse.com</a>, <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a> for the web, iOS and Android for mobile, I think it&#8217;s never been easier to create quality small scale projects. To be honest I wish I had started something like that years ago. If I was coming out of college now, one of the first things I&#8217;d do would be to register my name as a url and start hosting projects there. It&#8217;s something small but would really pay off down the line.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve signed up for a Start Your Own Business <a href="http://www.sceb.ie/Online-Booking#Start-Your-Own-Business">course</a> which is being run by the <a href="http://www.sceb.ie">South Cork Enterprise Board</a>. It&#8217;s an eight week course taking three hours every Thursday. I&#8217;ve no intention of leaving my current job but if I&#8217;m going to be doing this on the side, then I&#8217;d like to know how to do it properly and what type of supports are out there.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone to three nights already and I&#8217;m finding it very useful. I think that the process of creating a business plan focuses your mind on what you want to achieve. I&#8217;ve asked myself more questions about what I want to do with this app development in the past few weeks than in the previous two months. It&#8217;s also interesting meeting people there who are setting up non software businesses and seeing what common problems and tasks we have. It&#8217;s good to step outside the software/computing world for a bit and get a wider perspective on things. I hope to come out of this with a clear idea of where I want to take the app work and what I need to do to accomplish this.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post documents how I migrated the blog from <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> to <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a>. There are a number of bloggers who have written about switching their blogs to Octopress. I found these posts very helpful - <a href="http://scottmuc.com/migrated-to-octopress/">Scott Muc</a>, <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/">Matt Gemmell</a> and <a href="http://blog.bigdinosaur.org/setting-up-octopress/">Bigdinosaur Blog</a>. The basic sequence of steps I followed was</p>

<ul>
<li>Install Ruby.</li>
<li>Install Octopress.</li>
<li>Create account on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>.</li>
<li>Export previous blog from Wordpress and convert it to Markdown</li>
<li>Generate Octopress blog and publish it to Github.</li>
<li>In parallel I registered www.gerardcondon.com and set it up so that it pointed to the blog on Github.</li>
<li>Setup a drafts folder on Dropbox so that I can write posts from anywhere.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Ruby Setup</h2>

<p>The first step is to install <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>. If you want to, you can compile this from the source but the better option is to use a third party tool to install and manage Ruby. The one I used is <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">RVM</a>.</p>

<p>By default OS X Lion comes with 1.8.7 pre-installed but Octopress needs 1.9.2. (I tried 1.9.3 at first but Octopress reported an error). I read on Stack Overflow that it&#8217;s not recommended to upgrade the default installation but instead to install the newer version alongside it. RVM is designed to manage multiple versions of Ruby on a system so it&#8217;s a nice fit here.</p>

<p>The command to install Ruby is <code>rvm install 1.9.2</code>. However when I tried this I got errors complaining that the C compiler was LLVM based instead of gcc. To get around this I added the following flag <code>rvm install 1.9.2 --with-gcc=clang</code>. Now we can tell RVM to use version 1.9.2 with this command <code>rvm use 1.9.2</code>.</p>

<h2>Install Octopress</h2>

<p>Installing Octopress is very easy once Ruby is installed. The instructions can be found at <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/setup/">Octopress Setup</a>. The install command is <code>rake install</code> and then to build your website run <code>rake generate</code>. Octopress takes whatever pages and posts it finds under the source folder and builds these to a static website. These need to have particular file names and contents, so Octopress provides helper commands to generate a new post or page. These are <code>rake new_page["page_title"]</code> and <code>rake new_post["post_title"]</code> respectively.</p>

<h2>Export from Wordpress</h2>

<p>To export from Wordpress I simply used their export tool. This exported all the posts in their own html files. This would have been fine for Octopress but I wanted the whole site in Markdown, so I converted each post from html to markdown and added to the source/_posts folder.</p>

<h2>Host on Github</h2>

<p>Once you have the Octopress blog created you need to host it somewhere. I choose Github as it provides for free hosting of static blogs. Also if I do release some iOS code later it will be on Github, so there&#8217;s no harm in getting it set up now.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://code.dblock.org/octopress-setting-up-a-blog-and-contributing-to-an-existing-one">site</a> has a very good explanation of what is going on with Github. Basically we build our website locally to a folder named public. We create a repository on Github for our webpage. Octopress then uploads the contents of the public folder to the master branch on this repository whenever we run the <code>rake deploy</code> command. It is recommended that you upload the site source to a source branch on the repository. That way you can always regenerate the website even if you delete the local files.</p>

<h2>Register URL</h2>

<p>I decided to register www.gerardcondon.com for this site as I didn&#8217;t want to be tied to a Github url in the same way as I was tied to the Wordpress.com one. I didn&#8217;t need hosting or anything special - just forwarding. I used <a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a>. The price is really cheap for a .com address - only 6 or 7 dollars a year.</p>

<p>There are instructions on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a> on how to set up the forwarding. You need to setup an A record to redirect to www.github.com for your url without the www part, i.e. gerardcondon.com will redirect to www.github.com. Then you need to create a CNAME file in github and then setup a CNAME redirect for the www part of the url, i.e. www.gerardcondon.com redirects to gerardcondon.github.com. However I ran into some problems doing this on the namecheap site. When I tried to setup the CNAME I got the following errors</p>

<p><code>Improper records were NOT saved!</code>
<code>There were issues with some records and they were either set to default or completely removed. Please review the issues below and update again appropriately.</code>
<code>INVALID_ADDR: 'gerardcondon.github.com/' should not be an IP/ URL for CNAME record. (host name: www)</code></p>

<p>However I just connected to the online chat support and the person assigned to me fixed it up in a few minutes - I have to say they were really helpful. This DNS stuff takes a while to settle down - I think it was a day or so before it had propagated out. Since then I&#8217;ve had no trouble with it.</p>

<h2>Octopress tweaks</h2>

<p>I&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to Octopress to suit my own tastes.</p>

<ul>
<li>I changed the indented-lists setting to true in sass/custom/_layout.scss. Previously the numbers and bullets for lists were not in line with the rest of the post text but instead were placed in the left margin.</li>
<li>I reduced the size of the blockquotes in the sass/base/_typography.scss file, from 1.2 em down to 1 em to be the same size as normal text.</li>
<li>I changed the solarized theme from dark to light in sass/base/_solarized.scss.</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s really easy to make changes to Octopress, there is a folder called sass with most of the style stuff. There are a few configuration files also which can be updated. One nice thing about checking all this stuff into github is that you can go back and see what style updates you made in previous commits.</p>

<h2>Add Draft folder and sync with Dropbox</h2>

<p>At this stage Octopress was installed on my Macbook Air and working perfectly for me. One limitation of this setup was that I could only edit posts from that machine. I didn&#8217;t mind only being able to regenerate the site from the Air as that&#8217;s not a common task, but I wanted to be able to write posts from anywhere. I also wanted the ability to write draft posts and not have Octopress automatically publish those.</p>

<p>I found a technique for managing draft posts on <a href="http://www.i-m-code.com/blog/blog/2012/01/25/target-any-deployment-environment-in-octopress-with-ease/">Frozen Bytes</a>. This allows you to create a drafts folder and provides commands for moving posts between the draft and published state.</p>

<p>Using this, I created a folder called drafts in Dropbox. I then symlinked to this from inside the sources directory on the Air. All my drafts are now available in Dropbox and I can edit these anywhere. This is especially useful when editing from iOS as there are a number of markdown editors which can edit files on Dropbox.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I think that&#8217;s everything! It was fairly straightforward in retrospect to set up. The new setup works really well. I&#8217;m very happy with the look of Octopress and the editing workflow in markdown is much better than using the Wordpress editor. Looking forward to using it in future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Apple has just announced <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion">Mountain Lion</a>, the latest update to OS X, and it looks to have some interesting features. The main one I&#8217;m looking forward to is the addition of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/features.html#airplay">AirPlay</a> to the Mac. I love being able to stream video from the iPhone to the Apple TV. It&#8217;s really handy for the iTunes U lectures. However for normal videos that I have on the Mac, it&#8217;s annoying to have to convert them via <a href="http://www.inmethod.com/forum/posts/list/4529.page">Air Video Server</a> on the Mac and then use <a href="http://www.inmethod.com/air-video/index.html">Air Video</a> on the iPhone to get them to display on the Apple TV. Having AirPlay on the Mac stream directly to the Apple TV will be very handy. According to the docs, it&#8217;s just for streaming applications and presentations but perhaps they will open it up to interactive applications in future. I wonder what the latency would be like on this and if eventually it would be possible to play games via the Apple TV.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m finding that as I integrate more and more Apple devices into my setup, they all make each other work better. AirPlay is one example of this. Another is iTunes match which really starts to excel when you have multiple devices. Previously it was impossible to keep multiple iTunes in sync. It was a nightmare trying to add new music as it had to be added to each library separately. Now my music library is always in sync everywhere and when I add music to one library, it gets uploaded and is available on all others immediately. I haven&#8217;t always been too impressed with Apple&#8217;s cloud services (i.e. MobileMe was a bit of a disaster) but they&#8217;ve got it right with iTunes Match.</p>

<time datetime="2012-02-21T00:02:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 21<span>st</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a previous <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/blog/2012/02/17/adding-code-coverage-to-unit-tests/">post</a>, I described how I got code coverage up and running in Xcode 4.2. Apple have just released Xcode 4.3 and unfortunatly updating to this has broken my code coverage. The reason is that 4.3 removes the /Developer folder and moves this internally to the Xcode.app package. While this has good consequences - it should be possible to update Xcode from the App Store like a normal app - unfortunately it has also removed the libprofile_rt library from /Developer/usr/lib. I haven&#8217;t been able to find a new version of this library in Xcode 4.3. When I tried using the version from 4.2, I got &#8220;mach-o but wrong architecture&#8221; errors.</p>

<p>This means that when building my unit tests with Coverage I get link errors saying that I am missing llvm_gcda functions (llvm_gcda_start_file, llvm_gcda_increment_indirect_counter, llvm_gcda_emit_function, llvm_gcda_emit_arcs). I searched on Google to try and find a solution for 4.3 but it seemed all solutions were for 4.2 so I needed to try to solve this myself. The solution I came up with is fairly hacky. I&#8217;m hoping that as more people upgrade to 4.3, a better solution will be found and I can switch to that.</p>

<p>My solution is to take the actual file which contained the gcda functions in libprofile_rt, add it to my own source code and compile it myself. The file in question can be found on llvm.org - <a href="https://llvm.org/svn/llvm-project/llvm/trunk/runtime/libprofile/GCDAProfiling.c">here</a>. To get it to build locally I deleted the win32 and sys includes (lines 27 to 31 inclusive) and replaced the llvm include (line 23) with <code>#include "stdint.h"</code>. This builds fine using the Coverage build configuration and outputs the same gcda and gcno files as before. To make sure that this code doesn&#8217;t end up in the released project by accident, I&#8217;ve included it in the unit test bundle rather than the app bundle. This is fine for me as I only need coverage when running the tests anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Some feedback from Tom Black, who emailed me to point out that libprofile_rt can be found in <code>/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/usr/</code>
However this library did not work for either of us. Instead we got errors like
<code>The bundle “GCUtilsTests.octest” couldn’t be loaded because it is damaged or missing necessary resources.</code>
<code>Library not loaded: @executable_path ... libprofile_rt.dylib</code>
<code>Reason: image not found</code><br/>
Also this library didn&#8217;t produce .gcda files but instead generated .dia files which didn&#8217;t work in Coverflow.</p>

<p>What worked for Tom, but not for me, was not to include libprofile at all. This removed these errors and another incompatible binary error. Now however he got the following error.
<code>Detected an attempt to call a symbol in system libraries that is not present on the iPhone:
fopen$UNIX2003 called from function llvm_gcda_start_file</code>
He found the solution to this issue <a href="http://www.infinite-loop.dk/blog/2012/02/code-coverage-and-fopen-unix2003-problems/">here</a>. I still got link errors when I followed this though so I need to stick with my original solution.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another commenter Rajiv emailed me to say that creating a new target for his project made the coverage work for him. It generated the .gcda and .gcno files when he exited using exit(0). I&#8217;ve tried creating a new simple iOS app and I don&#8217;t get any errors for this when I enable coverage.</p>

<p>One thing which might explain why it still doesn&#8217;t work for some of my projects is the type of project being built. My original project was a static library. I tried to create a new static library project and when I try to enable coverage I get the same link errors as above.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you are going to the effort of having unit tests, then you really need to have code coverage. This will allow you to ensure that your tests are exercising all your code. It is really easy to spot a missing test when you see a branch of an if-else with no coverage. Code coverage for me is also a way to motivate myself to implement the tests. It&#8217;s like high scores in games - it gives me a target to aim for. Coverage gives feedback that your tests are actually doing something, and with each test you add, you can see the areas of untested code steadily decrease.</p>

<p>To set up code coverage in Xcode 4.2 I used the guide on these blogs - <a href="http://www.infinite-loop.dk/blog/2011/05/covering-it-all-up/">Infinite Loop</a> and <a href="http://mattrajca.com/post/8749868513/llvm-code-coverage-and-xcode-4">Matt Rajca</a>. Originally only the gcc compiler was supported but since then the Clang compiler has had code coverage enabled. This is important as we need to use Clang for ARC and static analysis among other things.</p>

<h3>XCode Build Settings</h3>

<p>Xcode has the concept of build configurations which can have built settings altered independently of each other. The two default configurations are Debug and Release. We want to add a new configuration named Coverage. To do this duplicate the Debug configuration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/codeCoverage/NewBuildConfig.png" title="New Build Configuration" ></p>

<p>In order to specify different settings for configurations in Xcode, hover over the left hand margin directly to the left of the setting we wish to update. An arrow will appear which when clicked will expand to an additional three lines for Debug, Coverage and Release. Editing the top line will alter the setting for all versions. Altering either of the new lines will only update the setting for that version of the build.</p>

<p><img src="/images/codeCoverage/BuildSettings.png" title="Build Settings" ></p>

<ul>
<li>Open the Build Settings tab for the main target. Under &#8220;Apple LLVM 3.0 compiler - Code Generation&#8221;, enable both

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Generate Test Coverage Files&#8221;</li>
<li> &#8220;Instrument Program Flow&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> We now need to add the libprofile_rt library to the build. This will link in the implementations of the coverage functions. If you are seeing link errors like &#8220;_llvm_gcda_increment_indirect_counter&#8221;, referenced from:&#8221;, then you have not done this step.<br/>
This library is located in /Developer/usr/lib. This folder contains libprofile.a which is a static library and a libprofile.dylib which is a dynamic linked library (similar to a .dll in Windows). To link this open the Build Phases tab for the main target. Expand the &#8220;Link Binary with Libraries&#8221; and click the + button. Click &#8220;Add Other&#8221; and then find libprofile_rt.dylib in the file viewer and add it. (Note that this doesn&#8217;t work for me since Xcode 4.3. I&#8217;ve documented the updates I needed to make <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com/blog/2012/02/21/code-coverage-updates-for-xcode-4-dot-3/">here</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Executing Tests</h3>

<p>Now your unit tests should run and if you examine the build output files under the DerivedData folder you should find .gcda and .gcno coverage files along with your .o files. To find this folder you can go to the Projects tab in the Organizer and select your project. The path to the Derived Data folder is listed here along with an arrow which will open the folder in the Finder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/codeCoverage/DerivedData.png" title="Derived Data" ></p>

<p>From here the path to the coverage files is Build/Intermediates/${Project Target}.build/Coverage-iphonesimulator/${Project Target}.build/Objects-normal/i386. Replace ${Project Target} with the name of your project target.</p>

<h3>Viewing Coverage Data</h3>

<p>To view the coverage data I used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/coverstory/">CoverStory</a>. Simply open the app and point it at the coverage folder. This will give a nice two pane display showing your files on the left and an editor which shows how often each line of code was hit. Now you can identify untested code and add new tests to cover them.</p>

<time datetime="2012-02-16T20:11:00+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Feb 16<span>th</span>, 2012</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve decided to switch the blog from <a href="http://www.wordpress.com">Wordpress.com</a> to an <a href="http://www.octopress.org">Octopress</a> site hosted on <a href="http://pages.github.com">Github Pages</a>. From now on there will be no more new posts on Wordpress. I&#8217;ve also registered the domain <a href="http://www.gerardcondon.com">gerardcondon.com</a> and will be using this address for the blog in future.</p>

<p>I have a few reasons for switching</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I found Wordpress.com to be an excellent site in general. When starting off it was very easy to create and get the blog up and running. However you have to use their site to create your posts. Even if you use a text editor you still ultimately have to paste the post into their site, and all subsequent edits have to be done through Wordpress.com. Also the definitive version of the posts are stored in their database.</p>

<p>  I prefer to write my documents in plain text files using a markup language. Previously I&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">Latex</a> and more recently I&#8217;ve started using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. This has a number of advantages, namely the files can be edited in any editor on any platform and they work very well with source control. Also by separating the content from the typesetting phase, I find that you concentrate better on the actual writing. I hate having to wrestle with formatting in Word; I much prefer leaving that to a program. Donald Knuth &amp; Co. have forgotten more about typesetting than I will ever know.</p>

<p>  Wordpress.com doesn&#8217;t support Markdown so posting involved an extra step of converting the Markdown to HTML. This meant that I had two versions of the blog. One in Markdown on my local machine and another in HTML on Wordpress. For me, it&#8217;s an axiom that whenever you have two versions of the same data, they will get out of sync. One needs to be the main source. I wanted the local Markdown version to be the canonical version of the site and everything else derived from that.</p></li>
<li><p>I think the default Octopress theme looks really good (I really like the Archive page). I first noticed it on <a href="http://www.mattgemmell.com">Matt Gemmell&#8217;s</a> site and was impressed by how it looked. It also looks well on mobile sites. I have full control of the css using Octopress so I can tweak whatever I want. I liked the <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/titan/">Titan</a> theme on Wordpress except I hated the crosses using for lists. On Wordpress.com there was no way to change these. However on Octopress I make any kind of style update.</p></li>
<li><p>I realised that I should get my own domain name instead of using the Wordpress.com address. In future if I need to move my site I can just redirect the domain name and any old links will still work. Whereas I will never own or control the gerardcondon.wordpress.com links. It&#8217;s better to move now, rather than after I create lots of content at a non portable url. Start as you mean to go on.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The posting workflow is much better now. I write my posts in Markdown on the Mac or on iOS via <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom">WriteRoom</a>. Then I run a command from the terminal to regenerate the site and deploy it to Github. Edits work in the same way. The Markdown files also get committed to Github ensuring that no matter where I move the blog in future I will always have the content in an accessible file format.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll add a few posts in future on how I got Octopress, Github and my domain all set up and working together.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>  Wherever possible I think that automating your testing is essential. For this project there is no way that I can manually rerun the same tests over and over again - the time commitment is just too much. I need to be able to click a button and have a framework run all my tests automatically and report back to me the number of tests passing, failing etc. I know that this won&#8217;t catch all the bugs in the code and that I&#8217;ll still need to do some manual testing for each release. However, the more I can push into this automated testing, the more time I&#8217;ll save on the manual testing later.</p>

<p>Based on my previous <a href="blog/2012/02/10/devising-my-unit-testing-philosophy/">post</a> I&#8217;ve mentally divided up the code into different layers which build on top of each other. The app GUI is one layer. Then we have the model classes which in turn depend on utility classes etc. These different levels of code require different levels of testing.</p>

<p>  For the utility and model layers I plan to use an automated unit testing framework such as <a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>. Xcode provides <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/UnitTesting/03-Writing_Test_Case_Methods/writing_tests.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002143-CH4-SW1">OCUnit</a> which is a JUnit like framework for implementing unit tests. This framework provides the usual fail and assert macros and functions. There are some annoying things about running unit tests in Xcode. One is that it doesn&#8217;t have a separate test runner panel like JUnit has in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Instead it treats the unit test errors as build failures. All the print output for the tests is dumped into the same console output which can make it tricky to identify which output is for which test. Also there is no way to selectively run these tests. You have to rerun them all together every time. There are other frameworks out there e.g. <a href="https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit">GHUnit</a> but for the moment I&#8217;ll stick with the default.</p>

<p>For the higher level GUI code, unit testing is not useful so I&#8217;ll need a different testing approach and toolset. There seem to be number of <a href="http://sgleadow.github.com/blog/2011/10/26/which-automated-ios-testing-tool-to-use/">options</a> out there. I&#8217;m not sure what is available and what is the best to use. Apple have an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/developertools/conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/Built-InInstruments/Built-InInstruments.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004652-CH6-SW75">Instruments</a> application which allows you do perform UI testing using Javascript. I&#8217;ve also seen these <a href="http://www.testingwithfrank.com/">Frank</a> and <a href="http://www.zucchiniframework.org/">Zucchini</a> frameworks. I haven&#8217;t evaluated any of these yet as I don&#8217;t have a fully functional app to test it on. Once I get a nearly complete app I can see how much my unit testing provides, compare that to what I have left to test, and then make a judgement on where to go from there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Up to now my approach to unit testing has been dictated by who I was writing the code for. For instance in college I never wrote unit tests. In the real world some of my employers required unit testing, with certain branch and code coverage goals, while other employers didn’t require much in the way of unit testing, as long as other types of testing were carried out. In practice I found that the as the code became more lower level, the demands for unit tests increased.</p>

<p>For this project I need to define for myself what level of testing I will perform. My initial assumption was that of course I would do unit testing. Personally I thought that the benefits of unit testing were</p>

<ul>
<li>the confidence that it gives me in my code. I know that I can call this piece of code from somewhere else and there is a high probability that it will work as intended.</li>
<li>by catching errors at an early stage, I spend less time in the debugger later.</li>
<li>refactoring should go easier as the unit tests will catch a lot of regression issues</li>
<li>I can be confident that any new bugs will be in the new code rather than the older highly unit tested modules, thus cutting down the amount of code required to search in order to fix the bug.</li>
</ul>


<p>However I read an interesting and thought provoking <a href="http://wilshipley.com/blog/2005/09/unit-testing-is-teh-suck-urr.html" title="">article</a> by Will Shipley outlining why he doesn’t do unit testing. My immediate reaction was astonishment. How can you not have unit tests? However instead of unit tests, he beta tests the product. This finds the type of bugs that the actual end users will find. Also he writes his code in a manner that doesn’t require unit tests.</p>

<blockquote><p>My programming philosophy is “less code is better code.” Unit tests take a lot of code, and in my projects I don’t find that they find very many bugs. Part of this is because I tend not to modify my individual methods much once they’ve been written; if my “append string to string” method works, it’s really not going to get revisited anytime soon unless it has a bug.
Part of it is because, in fact, I do do integrated testing of a form, and I probably should have talked about that more. Yes, I use “NSAssert” all over the place, and I perform sanity checks and raise errors if there’s a problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>I don’t think I’ve come across “Not modifying methods once they are written” before but looking at it now it makes sense. By not changing existing working methods and treating them as black boxes, we should have fewer regression errors in future. I’m not sure how to reconcile this with refactoring though - it’s something to think about. I’d imagine a coding style that favours smaller, more focused methods would be more suited to this approach.</p>

<p>His use of sanity checks and asserts also struck a chord especially when he says</p>

<blockquote><p>Debugging most errors, once found, should take very little time in a properly-written program, because the error should always be from one of your own sanity checks, and you know where those are in the code, so you just go there and figure out what went wrong.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was eye-opening for me. I’ve never tracked this before so I’m not sure if the bugs I’ve written have evaded my sanity checks and asserts. I would imagine a lot of them did. I’d never have seen that as important before but looking at it now it seems to me that this is a failure on my behalf. Not catching these errors means that I’m not fully aware of how my code can go wrong and what it is doing in all cases. I think a useful analysis I should run on each bug I find is - did this escape my coding checks/asserts and if so why? I should learn from this and in future code should check for this condition.</p>

<p>In a response to Will’s article, a <a href="http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/09/24/unit-testing">follow up post</a> by bbum shows how unit testing was of great benefit on infrastructure code, in this case the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/coredata.html">Core Data</a> library. This would suggest to me that the utility and model code would be amenable to unit testing but that it’s not useful for the GUI code.</p>

<p>Another <a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/08/24/writing-great-unit-tests-best-and-worst-practises/">article</a> on codeville challenged my assumptions that unit tests were about finding bugs. Instead the type of testing that finds bugs is manual testing or automated integration testing. According to him, unit testing is not about finding bugs (except during refactoring) but more about designing robust software components.</p>

<blockquote><p>TDD is a design process, not a testing process. TDD is a robust way of designing software components (“units”) interactively so that their behaviour is specified through unit tests
Also it’s not enough to just write unit tests. The tests need to be either true unit tests which design a single component or else integration tests which automate the entire system. Anything in between are
dirty hybrids. Unclear goal. High maintenance, don’t prove much
Otherwise when we refactor code, we end up breaking lots of seemingly unrelated hybrid tests. If you change a unit, then its unit tests should change but no other unit tests should.</p></blockquote>

<p>After all that I’ve decided that I want to do some level of unit testing but I realize that I need to focus it on the right areas. I think it will be useful for the utility type code that I write but that I need to do more research into how I want to implement integration testing and UI testing.</p>
